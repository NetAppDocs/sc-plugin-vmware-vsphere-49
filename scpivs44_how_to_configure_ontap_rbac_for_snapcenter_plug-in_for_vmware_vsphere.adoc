ONTAP RBAC applies only to SnapCenter Server application-consistent (application over VMDK) jobs.

You must configure ONTAP RBAC on the storage system if you want to use it with the SnapCenter VMware plug-in. From within ONTAP, you must perform the following tasks:

* Create a single role.

http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.netapp.doc.pow-adm-auth-rbac%2Fhome.html[ONTAP 9 Administrator Authentication and RBAC Power Guide^]

*  Create a username and password (storage system credentials) in ONTAP for the role.
+
This storage system credential is needed to allow you to configure the storage systems for the SnapCenter VMware plug-in. You do this by entering the credentials in the plug-in. Each time you log in to a storage system using these credentials, you are presented with the set of SnapCenter functions that you set up in ONTAP when you created the credentials.

You can use the administrator or root login to access all the SnapCenter tasks; however, it is a good practice to use the RBAC feature provided by ONTAP to create one or more custom accounts with limited access privileges.
